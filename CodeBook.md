## Code Book

This code book will describe the data used in this project, as well as the processing required to create the resulting tidy data set.

### Overview

30 volunteers performed 6 different activities while wearing a smartphone. The smartphone captured various data about their movements.

### Explanation of each file

* `features.txt`: Names of the 561 features.
* `activity_labels.txt`: Names and IDs for each of the 6 activities.

* `X_train.txt`: 7352 observations of the 561 features, for 21 of the 30 volunteers.
* `subject_train.txt`: A vector of 7352 integers, denoting the ID of the volunteer related to each of the observations in `X_train.txt`.
* `y_train.txt`: A vector of 7352 integers, denoting the ID of the activity related to each of the observations in `X_train.txt`.

* `X_test.txt`: 2947 observations of the 561 features, for 9 of the 30 volunteers.
* `subject_test.txt`: A vector of 2947 integers, denoting the ID of the volunteer related to each of the observations in `X_test.txt`.
* `y_test.txt`: A vector of 2947 integers, denoting the ID of the activity related to each of the observations in `X_test.txt`.

### Data files that were not used

This analysis was performed using only the files described above, and did not use the files in the dataset downloaded.

### Processing steps

1. All of the described files were read into data frames, appropriate column headers were added, and the training and test sets were combined into a single data set.
2. All feature columns were removed that did not contain the exact string "mean()" or "std()".
3. The activity column was converted from a integer to a factor, using labels describing the activities.
4. A tidy data set was created containing the mean of each feature for each subject and each activity.
5. The file named "tidyset.csv" is the final output of the script.
