## This is the final project for the module 3 of the Data Science Specialization

The class project for [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata) was to read in the ["Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones), perform an analysis on the data set, and output a tidy data set.

In order to run the script, you must download the data files ( https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip )

Once downloaded the file, you just need to unzip it and save the R script inside the folder "UCI HAR Dataset" and run it.
The final output of the script is a CSV file named "tidyset.csv".
